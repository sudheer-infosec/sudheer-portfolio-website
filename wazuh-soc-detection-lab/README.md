## Project Summary

This repository documents a **real Wazuh-based SOC lab** built to simulate and investigate security activity in a controlled environment.

The lab was designed to practice core Blue Team workflows including:

- **SIEM alert monitoring**
- **Detection engineering**
- **Custom Wazuh rule creation**
- **Windows and Linux telemetry analysis**
- **Incident investigation**
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**
- **Attacker activity simulation**

This project reflects the type of workflow expected in a **junior SOC analyst / Blue Team / detection engineering** environment.

## Detection Coverage

This lab includes **working detections validated in the environment**.

### Linux Detections (Ubuntu)

#### 1) SSH Invalid User Authentication Attempt
- **Rule ID:** `100201`
- **Severity:** High
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** `T1110.001` (Password Guessing), `T1021.004` (SSH)

**Detection Goal:**  
Identify failed SSH login attempts using invalid usernames, which may indicate brute-force or reconnaissance activity.

### Detection Example – SSH Invalid User Authentication Attempt

#### 2) Suspicious Sudo Privilege Escalation
- **Rule ID:** `100203`
- **Severity:** High
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** `T1548.003` (Sudo and Sudo Caching)

**Detection Goal:**  
Detect potentially suspicious privilege escalation attempts using `sudo`.

---

#### 3) Critical Sensitive File Modification
- **Rule ID:** `100204`
- **Severity:** Critical
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** `T1565.001` (Stored Data Manipulation)

**Detection Goal:**  
Detect unauthorized or high-risk modifications to sensitive files.

---

### Windows Detections (WS-25)

#### 4) Suspicious PowerShell Execution
- **Rule ID:** `100304`
- **Severity:** High
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** `T1059.001` (PowerShell)

**Detection Goal:**  
Identify suspicious or attacker-like PowerShell activity captured via Sysmon and ingested into Wazuh.

## Investigation Scenarios

This repository includes SOC-style investigations for validated detection scenarios.

### Included Investigation Workflows
- Linux authentication anomaly review
- Linux privilege escalation analysis
- Linux file integrity alert investigation
- Windows PowerShell execution triage

Each investigation focuses on:
- alert context
- event evidence
- analyst interpretation
- detection logic
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- triage outcome
